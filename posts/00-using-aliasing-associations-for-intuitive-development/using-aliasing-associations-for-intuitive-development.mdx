This is a reflection write-up on a Rails project I recently completed for the Flatiron School’s Software Engineering program. This project features a support ticket system that provides frequently asked questions, commenting, tagging, and searching functions. It also allows admins to schedule meetings with users as well as start and manage tasks associated with the support tickets.

When creating an association, Active Record makes these two assumptions:

First, the class name of the model your association points to is based directly off the name of the association. For example, if I write my association as below, ActiveRecord will look for classes named `Requester` and `Requestee` as the receiver of the Meeting’s `belongs_to` association.

```rb
class Meeting < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :requester
  belongs_to :requestee
end
```

Second, the foreign key in any `belongs_to` relationship will be called `associationname_id`. This means, such as in the above example, ActiveRecord assumes the `meetings` table has a `requester_id` column pointing to a requesters table and a `requestee_id` column pointing to a `requestees` table.

However, we often need to set up our associations such that one model can reference another model with two different names. In my above example, both `requester` and `requestee` are users stored on the `users` table referenced in the User model. Therefore, a user can request meetings (be the requester) and receive meeting requests (be the requestee). A meeting, on the other hand, belongs to a requester and a requestee, both of which are users.

### Aliasing in the belongs_to model

The association on the Meeting model’s side is a basic one-to-one connection with an aliasing element:

```ruby
#app/models/meeting.rb

class Meeting < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :requester, class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :requestee, class_name: 'User'

  ... ...
end
```

### Define references in the migration

To alias a user as either a requester or requestee on the meetings table, the references in the migration table might look like below:

```ruby
class CreateMeetings < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def change
    create_table :meetings do |t|
      t.references :requester, references: :users, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }
      t.references :requestee, references: :users, foreign_key: { to_table: :users}
    end
  end

end
```

The `foreign_key: { to_table: :association }` syntax ensures that the `:requester` and `:requestee` columns on the meetings table are not looking for tables with the name “requester” and “requestee.” Rather, the association should actually point to the `users` table.

### Aliasing in the has_many model

On the User model, we can’t use `has_many :meetings` as we do not have any column named `user_id` in table `meetings`. We can reference meetings as either “requested_meetings” or “requesting_meetings” like so:

```ruby
#app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :requesting_meetings, class_name: "Meeting", foreign_key: "requester_id"
  has_many :requested_meetings, class_name: "Meeting", foreign_key: "requestee_id"
  ... ...
end
```

This way, we can call `User.first.requested_meetings` as well as `User.first.requesting_meetings`. We can also define a `meetings` method that returns the combination of `requested_meetings` and `requesting_meetings`.

However, while the project requires a distinction between requesters and requestees, it doesn’t require a distinction between requested meetings and requesting meetings. From the performance point of view, two queries need to be made to get the `meetings`. Therefore, I wrote a custom class method in the User model like so:

```ruby
#app/models/user.rb

class User < ApplicationRecord
  ... ...
  def meetings
    Meeting.where("requester_id = ? OR requestee_id = ?", id, id)
  end
  ... ...
end
```

### Establish relationship in controller

After the associations are set up in the database and models, we can establish the relationship between meetings, requestees, and requesters with ease. In my project, an admin requests meetings with regular users, who submit support tickets and are referenced as “submitter”. And a support ticket can have many meetings. In the meeting controller’s create action, we can easily establish the relationship like so:

```ruby
#app/controllers/meetings_controller.rb

class MeetingsController < ApplicationController
... ...
  def create
    @meeting = @ticket.meetings.build(meeting_params)
    @meeting.requester = current_user
    @meeting.requestee = @ticket.submitter
    if @meeting.save
      MeetingMailer.meeting_schedule_notification(@meeting).deliver_later
      redirect_to @meeting, notice: 'Meeting requested'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
... ...
end
```

### Use aliased associations in views and mailers

After a meeting’s requester and requestee are set, we can retrieve `@meeting.requester` and `@meeting.requestee` with convenience in our views and mailers. For example, I set up the logic in my `meetings_helper` to determine which views to render according to the `current_user`’s relation to the meeting.

```ruby
#app/helpers/meetings_helper.rb

module MeetingsHelper
  def set_meeting_with(meeting)
    current_user == meeting.requester ? meeting.requestee.name : meeting.requester.name
  end

  def show_requestee_meeting_actions(meeting)
    return unless current_user == meeting.requestee && meeting.requested?
    render 'meetings/shared/requestee_actions', meeting: meeting
  end

  def show_requester_meeting_actions(meeting)
    return unless current_user == meeting.requester
    render 'meetings/shared/requester_actions', meeting: meeting
  end
 ... ...
end
```

This also allows me convenience in the mailers where I only passed through the meeting argument:

```ruby
#app/mailers/meeting_mailer.rb

class MeetingMailer < ApplicationMailer
  add_template_helper(MeetingsHelper)
  def meeting_schedule_notification(meeting)
    @meeting = meeting
    mail(to: @meeting.requestee.email, subject: "#{@meeting.requester.name} Requested a Meeting With You")
  end
... ...
end
```

I hope you use aliasing association as one of your tools of “automagic” provided by the ActiveRecord ORM to make database queries intuitive and convenient in your development process.
