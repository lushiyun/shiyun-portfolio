            Currently based in DC, I grew up in China, lived a year in Egypt and
            a couple months in Ethiopia. I studied international relations and
            have worked on the Middle East and Africa for five years.

            I can't stop learning, so I recently spent five fullfilling months
            studying software engineering at the Flatiron school. I currently
            love React, Redux, and Rails. My favorite developer is Mark
            "acemarke" Erikson. And I want to connect people across the world
            through technology.{" "}
            <span className={styles.emphasize}>Email me if you want to be my first employer in tech!</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I love street food, I waste time on K-pop, and I'm always advocating
            for happy hours with bubble tea.
